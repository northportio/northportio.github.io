# ðŸ‘‹ Hey There!

I'm Alec Dobler, owner of a tech company that services small and medium businesses. In my free time, I'm always learning something new (both tech related and not-tech related).

### What I'm currently learning/studying:
- FAA Part 107 Remote Pilot Certificate
    - I'm studying for the part 107 exam from [Pilot Institute](https://pilotinstitute.com). This would allow me to become a commercial drone pilot. Not only do I have an interest in aerial photography, but also would be able to use these skills to do mapping and planning for IT deployments across a large area.

### Things I advocate for:
- Learning & Education
    - This keeps our minds sharp at all times, and knowledge is something no one can take from you.
- Easy access to telecommunications
    - When we're able to communicate, we're able to learn, work, and connect.
- Emergency preparedness
    - Being prepared as best as possible, will not only benefit you, but everyone you come into contact with.
- The Right to Privacy
    - Our data is out there. It is not a matter of if you will be the victim of identity theft, or some other personal data breach. It's only a matter of when. Increasingly over the past few years companies have taken our data and either sold it, or did not secure it enough. This data can be used against us in ways that we can't even begin to imagine. Our data should not be used against us.

## Organizations/Entities I Support
- [ITDRC - Information Technology Disaster Resource Center](https://www.itdrc.org)
    - After natural disasters strike, the most important thing is being able to let your loved-ones know that you are okay and safe. ITDRC provides communications and internet connectivity in areas that have been hard hit by natural disasters. They not only provide people activity to their loved ones, but also resources on how to rebuild and recover.
- [EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org)
    - The EFF is focused on defending digital privacy, free speech, and innovation in our increasingly technological world. 
- [CISA - Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://cisa.gov)
    - Many may not agree on what the government is doing a good job at, but there is one agency that many industry professionals respect and utilize as resource. CISA Is an agency that looks out for not only Governments of all sizes, but also many businesses that we've come to rely on. They work with many well-respected, cyber security firms, and put out notices, notifying the broader IT community on the threats that are actively being used in the wild.
